# Hulu Clone by Mahesh

This is a portfolio project that I did most of the parts on my own. Anyway the thing that started off this project was a youtube video from **[Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ)**.

<br>

I have deployed this app on firebase at [https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/](https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/).

## What is in it?

- You can surf around the site to find details about your favourite movies.
- Watchlist functionality is there and you can add *yet to be watched* movies into that list.
- Movies are segregated by various genres and you can look around for movies in whatever genre you prefer.
- There is a search functionality available and don't forget to choose whether you are searching for a movie or a tv show. 
- Casting Page is available, just look for the button. 
- Some of your local language movies may be available, try looking for them.
  
## What's not in it? 

- Obviously, you **can't watch** any of the movies or tv shows. This is just a project for my resume.
- The site **hasn't been optimized for mobile view** even a bit, so please don't try seeing this in a mobile view. 
- ~~There is an unsolved bug, the **page whites out** when you reload or hit *open link in new tab*.~~
- ~~Don't try **altering the url**, it won't work either.~~

- (Dec-7-2020) commit --> I have solved this firebase bug using a **[stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48826489/react-production-router-404-after-deep-refresh-firebase)**. So I've striked out the above-mentioned limitations. The following one still stands tho. xD
- P.S --> *I am not a firebase expert.*

Support a fellow developer by giving a **star**, although I feel kind of *cringy* when asking for it. 

## Pull requests

If you think you are capable of solving the above mentioned bugs, please help me out. You can fork the project and submit a **pull request**. You can also do it with the latest *GitHub Cli* with the command `gh repo fork mahessh77melo/hulu-clone --clone`. Commit your changes in a new branch and then `gh pr create`.
As most of you may know, the command to start the development server is `npm start` in the project directory.
