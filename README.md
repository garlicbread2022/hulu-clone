# Hulu Clone by Mahesh

This is a portfolio project that I did most of the parts on my own. Anyway the thing that started off this project was a youtube video from **[Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ)**.

<br>

I have deployed this app on firebase at [https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/](https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/).

## What is in it?

- You can surf around the site to find details about your favourite movies.
- Watchlist functionality is there and you can add *yet to be watched* movies into that list.
- Movies are segregated by various genres and you can look around for movies in whatever genre you prefer.
- There is a search functionality available and don't forget to choose whether you are searching for a movie or a tv show. 
- Casting Page is available, just look for the button. 
- A search functionality feature for people is available. You can look for a cast member, a director etc.
- When the people search result is available, you can see the movies that the person is known for.
- For TV Shows, extra pages have been added which show the list of seasons and list of episodes.
- Some of your local language movies may be available, try looking for them.
  
## What's not in it? 

- Obviously, you **can't watch** any of the movies or tv shows. This is just a project for my resume.
- The site **hasn't been optimized for mobile view** even a bit, so please don't try seeing this in a mobile view.

Support a fellow developer by giving a **star**, although I feel kind of *cringy* when asking for it.

You can also do it with the latest *GitHub Cli* with the command `gh repo fork mahessh77melo/hulu-clone --clone`. Commit your changes in a new branch and then `gh pr create`.
As most of you may know, the command to start the development server is `npm start` in the project directory.
